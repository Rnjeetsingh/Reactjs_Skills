Here I will prepare ReactJs for Interview .

Chapter-1 :
        1. Functional Components.
        2. Destructruning.
        3. Props.
        4. Import and Export.
        5. Json data 
        6. Map Function

Chapter-2 :
        1. useState.
        2. Delete Opretion.
        3. Update Opretion.
        4. Import and Export.
        5. Json data.
        6. Fillter Function.
        7. Map Function.    
        8. Form Handling.  
        9.The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component. 

Chapter-3 : 
        1.useEffect.
        2.useState.
        3.Tarnary Opretor. 
        4.Fetch Api.
        5.Loading.
        6.Error handling.
        7.Async and await.
        8.The useEffect Hook allows to perform side effects in components.
        9.useEffect(callback, dependencies) is the hook that manages the side-effects in functional components. 

Chapter-4 : 
        1.memo.
        2.Rendring state.
        3.useMemo.
        4.dependecy.
        5.memo will cause React to skip rendering a component if its props have not changed.
        component re-renders whenever any prop is not shallowly equal to what it was previously. 

Chapter-5 : 
        1.contextAPI.
        2.creatContext.
        3.Provider and Consumer.
        4.Stop Props Drilling.        
        5.useContext.
        6.Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. 
        7.Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around.

Chapter-6 : 
        1.useReducer.
        2.state and dispatch.
        3.action , type and payload.
        4.Switch function.        
        5.Fetch data, async and await.
        6.map,filtir,list.
        7.It allows for custom state logic. 
        8.It lets move the state update logic from event handlers into a single function outside of component. 

Chapter-7 : 
        1.useRef.
        2.render.current.
        3.ref={data}.
        4.useRef DOM.        
        5.Help to select element.   
        6.The useRef Hook allows us to persist values between renders.     
        7.It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
        8.useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument ( initialValue ).

Chapter-8 : 
        1.customHook.
        2.creat lowercase componet.
        3.return store state inside [data],{data}.
        4.To use customHook import first.        
        5.Import and use const [data] = useCostom().
        6.Help to use same data in different components.   
        7.custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more.
        8. With custom React Hooks, we can reuse stateful logic easily across different components in an optimized and scalable format.


Chapter-9 : 
        1.useLayoutEffect.
        2.useEffect is asynchronous.
        3.useLayoutEffect is synchronous.
        4.asynchronous function is wait whail runing.        
        5.synchronous function not wait for runing.
        7.It's component use layout information for rendering
        8.The useLayoutEffect function is triggered synchronously before the DOM mutations are painted.

Chapter-10 : 
        1.useTransition.
        2.It's update the state without blocking the UI.
        3.It's specify any state updates as non-urgent.
